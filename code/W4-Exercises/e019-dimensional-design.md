# Collaborative Project: Dimensional Model Design

## Overview

This is a **collaborative project** where you will work with a partner to design a complete dimensional model for a real-world business scenario. This project synthesizes the entire week's topics including data warehousing, dimensional modeling, star schema design, and slowly changing dimensions.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply dimensional modeling methodology to a business problem
- Design fact and dimension tables following best practices
- Implement slowly changing dimension strategies
- Practice collaborative design and peer review
- Create professional technical documentation

## Exercise Mode: Collaborative (Hybrid - Design then Implement)

This is a pair exercise using the **Architect/Critic** format. One partner designs while the other reviews and challenges.

## Team Roles

- **Architect**: Leads the design, creates diagrams, defines schemas
- **Critic**: Reviews for completeness, identifies gaps, suggests improvements

Roles should swap halfway through the project.

## The Business Scenario

**Company:** StreamFlix - A video streaming service

**Business Requirements:**
StreamFlix needs a data warehouse to analyze:

1. **User Viewing Behavior**: What content is being watched, when, and for how long
2. **Content Performance**: Which shows/movies perform best by various dimensions
3. **Subscription Analytics**: User acquisition, churn, and revenue analysis
4. **Device Analytics**: Which devices are used, streaming quality metrics

**Source Systems:**

- User database (PostgreSQL)
- Content catalog (MongoDB)
- Streaming events (Kafka)
- Billing system (Stripe API)
- Device telemetry (IoT platform)

## Deliverables

### Part 1: Business Process Selection

Identify 2-3 key business processes to model. For each:

- Business process name
- Business questions it will answer
- Potential grain of the fact table
- Source systems involved

### Part 2: Dimensional Model Design

For each business process, create:

#### 2.1 Fact Table Design

Document for each fact table:

- Table name
- Grain statement (one specific sentence)
- List of foreign keys to dimensions
- List of measures with type (additive/semi-additive/non-additive)
- Fact table type (transaction/periodic snapshot/accumulating)

#### 2.2 Dimension Table Design

Document for each dimension:

- Table name
- Surrogate key name
- Natural key(s)
- Key attributes (at least 10 per major dimension)
- Hierarchies
- SCD Type for each attribute (0, 1, 2, or 3)

#### 2.3 Star Schema Diagram

Create a diagram showing:

- Fact tables in the center
- Dimension tables surrounding facts
- Foreign key relationships
- Cardinalities

Use Mermaid, draw.io, or another diagramming tool.

### Part 3: Physical Design Considerations

Document:

- Partitioning strategy for each fact table
- Clustering columns for each table
- Estimated table sizes and growth rates
- Recommended load frequency

### Part 4: SCD Implementation Example

Write SQL DDL for one dimension with SCD Type 2:

- Table structure with effective/end dates
- Sample MERGE statement for handling updates

### Part 5: Peer Review

Swap designs with your partner and complete a review checklist:

| Criterion | Y/N | Comments |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| Grain clearly defined | | |
| Surrogate keys used | | |
| Dimensions fully denormalized | | |
| SCD types appropriate | | |
| Date dimension included | | |
| Conformed dimensions identified | | |
| Partitioning makes sense | | |
| Documentation complete | | |

## Definition of Done

- Business process matrix completed
- At least 2 fact tables fully designed

## Collaboration Tips

1. Start with a 15-minute planning session to align on approach
2. Use screen sharing or a collaborative whiteboard
3. The Critic should ask "why" questions, not just approve
4. Document disagreements and how you resolved them
5. Both partners should understand every design decision
